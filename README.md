##About

PReports (abbr for project reports) lets you write project reports (tailored for IT) in you browser on the fly. More information on the [Official homepage](http://p-reports.com).

##Installation
*WORK IN PROGRESS*

###Development Setup
####Prerequisites
For development please install
- NodeJS 4.2.3
- npm install -g bower, grunt-cli
- [Compass](http://compass-style.org/install/) for SASS, needs Ruby
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.org/)

Optional
- npm install -g supervisor

####Run it
1. Check out development (or master for last stable) branch.
2. Make sure a mongo daemon is running on your local machine (or a remote machine, that you can reach)
3. CD into root folder
4. Set up environment variables (see below)
5. RUN npm install
6. RUN 'supervisor app.js' (or node if you didn't install supervisor). This will fire up the backend
and you should see something like this.
```
Starting child process with 'node app.js'
Watching directory '/Users/fred/Dev/preports/service' for changes.
connect.multipart() will be removed in connect 3.0

```
7. CD into client folder
8. RUN npm install && bower install (this will install the frontend dependencies)
9. RUN grunt serve (This will fire up a webserver on port 9000 an show the UI.)

```
...
Running "connect:livereload" (connect) task
Started connect web server on 0.0.0.0:9000.

Running "watch" task
Waiting...

```
10. Go and code... All changes should be picked up immediately.
