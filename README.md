PReports project is based on MEAN stack: MongoDB, ExpressJS, AngularJS, NodeJS

##About

PReports (short for project reports) lets you write project reports (tailored for IT) in your browser on the fly. More information on the [official homepage](http://p-reports.com).

##Setup

###Dev
####Prerequisites
Install
- [NodeJS > 4.2.3](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- `npm install -g bower grunt-cli`
- [Compass](http://compass-style.org/install/) for SASS, needs Ruby
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.org/)

Optional
- `npm install -g supervisor`

####Run it
1. Check out development (or master for last stable) branch.
2. Make sure a mongo daemon is running on your local machine (or a remote machine)
3. CD into project root folder
4. Set up environment variables (see below)
5. RUN `npm install`
6. RUN `supervisor app.js` (or node if you didn't install supervisor). This will fire up the backend
and you should see something like this.

    ```
    Starting child process with 'node app.js'
    Watching directory '/Users/fred/Dev/preports/service' for changes.
    connect.multipart() will be removed in connect 3.0
    visit https://github.com/senchalabs/connect/wiki/Connect-3.0 for alternatives
    connect.limit() will be removed in connect 3.0
    Initialize passport
    Authentication disabled
    Using MONGODB_DB_CONNECTION
    Connecting to mongo db: mongodb://localhost:27017/preports
    directory for upload: undefined
    Wed Jan 13 2016 20:36:00 GMT+0100 (CET): Node server started on undefined:3000 ...
    Connected to 'project report' database
    createIndexes: created index searchIndex_1
    ```
7. CD into client folder
8. RUN `npm install && bower install` (this will install the frontend dependencies)
9. RUN `grunt serve` (This will fire up a webserver on port 9000 an show the UI.)

    ```
    ...
    Running "connect:livereload" (connect) task
    Started connect web server on 0.0.0.0:9000.
    
    Running "watch" task
    Waiting...
    
    ```
10. Go and code... All changes should be picked up immediately.
11. visit http://localhost:9000
12. To run tests RUN `npm test` in root folder. Currently only backend tests exists.

####Build it
To have a production build CD into client folder and execute `grunt build --force`.
This creates a new minified UI build in /dist folder that gets served by the backend.
You can access the dist build via http://localhost:3000
Commit and push the "build" to your repository. Thats it.


###Production

####Standalone
Install
- NodeJS > 4.2.3
- `npm install -g forever` (To run your script continously)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.org/) preferably on another server

####Docker (experimental)
Install
- Docker obviously and docker-compose
- Tune env variables in docker-compose.yml to suite your needs

####Run it...
1. Checkout the source with the latest UI dist build on your prod host
2. CD into src root
3. Adjust config and env variables
4. RUN `npm install`
5. RUN `forever app.js`
  1. or RUN `docker-compose -d up` when using docker

This may not be the best approach. One might want to check out
[Strongloop](https://strongloop.com) as a tool for node app building and deployment.
Check out their [post](/strongblog/node-js-deploy-production-best-practice/) regarding best practices.
